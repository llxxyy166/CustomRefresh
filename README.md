# CustomRefresh
A Custom UITableView refreshcontrol. It seems there are some bugs in table view's refresh control. The refresh control's
boundary is usually unchanged but if set some of its property like background color, its height start changing while 
pull down. Also it seems there is no way to find out the distance need to pull down to trigger the refreshing.
